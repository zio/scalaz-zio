/**
 * A lock-free array-based bounded queue. It is thread-safe and can be
 * used in multiple-producer/multiple-consumer (MPMC) setting.
 *
 * =Main concepts=
 *
 * A simple array-based queue of size N uses an array `buf` of size N
 * as an underlying storage. There are 2 pointers `head` and
 * `tail`. The element is enqueued into `buf` at position `tail % N`
 * and dequeued from `head % N`. Each time an enqueue happens `tail`
 * is incremented, similarly when dequeue happens `head` is
 * incremented.
 *
 * Since pointers wrap around the array as they get incremented such
 * data structure is also called a
 * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer circular buffer]]
 * or a ring buffer.
 *
 * Because queue is bounded, enqueue and dequeue may fail, which is
 * captured in the semantics of `offer` and `poll` methods.
 *
 * Using `offer` as an example, the algorithm can be broken down
 * roughly into three steps:
 *  1. Find a place to insert an element.
 *  2. Reserve this place, put an element and make it visible to
 *     other threads (store and publish).
 *  3. If there was no place on step 1 return false, otherwise
 *     returns true.
 *
 * Steps 1 and 2 are usually done in a loop to accommodate the
 * possibility of failure due to race. Depending on the
 * implementation of these steps the resulting queue will have
 * different characteristics. For instance, the more sub-steps are
 * between reserve and publish in step 2, the higher is the chance
 * that one thread will delay other threads due to being descheduled.
 *
 * =Notes on the design=
 *
 * The queue uses a `buf` array to store elements. It uses `seq`
 * array to store longs which serve as:
 * 1. an indicator to producer/consumer threads whether the slot is
 *    right for enqueue/dequeue,
 * 2. an indicator whether the queue is empty/full,
 * 3. a mechanism to ''publish'' changes to `buf` via volatile write
 *    (can even be relaxed to ordered store).
 * See comments in `offer`/`poll` methods for more details on `seq`.
 *
 * The benefit of using `seq` + `head`/`tail` counters is that there
 * are no allocations during enqueue/dequeue and very little
 * overhead. The downside is it doubles (on 64bit) or triples
 * (compressed OOPs) the amount of memory needed for a queue.
 *
 * Concurrent enqueues and concurrent dequeues are possible. However
 * there is no ''helping'', so threads can delay other threads, and
 * thus the queue doesn't provide full set of lock-free
 * guarantees. In practice it's usually not a problem, since benefits
 * are simplicity, zero GC pressure and speed.
 *
 * There are 2 implementations of a RingBuffer:
 * 1. `RingBufferArb` that supports queues with arbitrary capacity;
 * 2. `RingBufferPow2` that supports queues with only power of 2
 *     capacities.
 *
 * The reason is `head % N` and `tail % N` are rather cheap when can
 * be done as a simple mask (N is pow 2), and pretty expensive when
 * involve an `idiv` instruction. The difference is especially
 * pronounced in tight loops (see. RoundtripBenchmark).
 *
 * To ensure good performance reads/writes to `head` and `tail`
 * fields need to be independent, e.g. they shouldn't fall on the
 * same (adjacent) cache-line.
 *
 * We can make those counters regular volatile long fields and space
 * them out, but we still need a way to do CAS on them. The only way
 * to do this except `Unsafe` is to use `AtomicLongFieldUpdater`,
 * which is exactly what we have here.
 *
 * @see [[zio.internal.MutableQueueFieldsPadding]] for more details on padding
 * and object's memory layout.
 *
 * The design is heavily inspired by such libraries as
 * [[https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor]] and
 * [[https://github.com/JCTools/JCTools]] which is based off
 * D. Vyukov's design
 * [[http://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms/queues/bounded-mpmc-queue]]
 *
 * Compared to JCTools this implementation doesn't rely on
 * `sun.misc.Unsafe`, so it is arguably more portable, and should be
 * easier to read. It's also very extensively commented, including
 * reasoning, assumptions, and hacks.
 *
 * =Alternative designs=
 *
 * There is an alternative design described in
 * [[http://pirkelbauer.com/papers/icapp16.pdf the paper]] A Portable
 * Lock-Free Bounded Queue by Pirkelbauer et al.
 *
 * It provides full lock-free guarantees, which generally means that
 * one out of many contending threads is guaranteed to make progress
 * in a finite number of steps. The design thus is not susceptible to
 * threads delaying other threads.
 *
 * However the helping scheme is rather involved and cannot be
 * implemented without allocations (at least I couldn't come up with
 * a way yet). This translates into worse performance on average, and
 * better performance in some very specific situations.
