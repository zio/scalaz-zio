/**
 * A synchronization aid that allows a set of fibers to all wait for each other
 * to reach a common barrier point.
 *
 * CyclicBarriers are useful in programs involving a fixed sized party of fibers
 * that must occasionally wait for each other. The barrier is called cyclic
 * because it can be re-used after the waiting fibers are released.
 *
 * A CyclicBarrier supports an optional action command that is run once per
 * barrier point, after the last fiber in the party arrives, but before any
 * fibers are released. This barrier action is useful for updating shared-state
 * before any of the parties continue.
