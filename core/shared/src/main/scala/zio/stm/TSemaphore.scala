/**
 * A `TSemaphore` is a semaphore that can be composed transactionally. Because
 * of the extremely high performance of ZIO's implementation of software
 * transactional memory `TSemaphore` can support both controlling access to
 * some resource on a standalone basis as well as composing with other STM
 * data structures to solve more advanced concurrency problems.
 *
 * For basic use cases, the most idiomatic way to work with a semaphore is to
 * use the `withPermit` operator, which acquires a permit before executing
 * some `ZIO` effect and release the permit immediately afterward. The permit
 * is guaranteed to be released immediately after the effect completes
 * execution, whether by success, failure, or interruption. Attempting to
 * acquire a permit when a sufficient number of permits are not available will
 * semantically block until permits become available without blocking any
 * underlying operating system threads. If you want to acquire more than one
 * permit at a time you can use `withPermits`, which allows specifying a
 * number of permits to acquire. You can also use `withPermitManaged` or
 * `withPermitsManaged` to acquire and release permits within the context of
 * a managed effect for composing with other resources.
 *
 * For more advanced concurrency problems you can use the `acquire` and
 * `release` operators directly, or their variants `acquireN` and `releaseN`,
 * all of which return STM transactions. Thus, they can be composed to form
 * larger STM transactions, for example acquiring permits from two different
 * semaphores transactionally and later releasing them transactionally to
 * safely synchronize on access to two different mutable variables.
