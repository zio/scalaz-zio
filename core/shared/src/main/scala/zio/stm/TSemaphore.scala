/**
 * A `TSemaphore` is a semaphore that can be composed transactionally. Because
 * of the extremely high performance of ZIO's implementation of software
 * transactional memory `TSemaphore` can support both controlling access to some
 * resource on a standalone basis as well as composing with other STM data
 * structures to solve more advanced concurrency problems.
 *
 * For basic use cases, the most idiomatic way to work with a semaphore is to
 * use the `withPermit` operator, which acquires a permit before executing some
 * `ZIO` effect and release the permit immediately afterward. The permit is
 * guaranteed to be released immediately after the effect completes execution,
 * whether by success, failure, or interruption. Attempting to acquire a permit
 * when a sufficient number of permits are not available will semantically block
 * until permits become available without blocking any underlying operating
 * system threads. If you want to acquire more than one permit at a time you can
 * use `withPermits`, which allows specifying a number of permits to acquire.
 * You can also use `withPermitScoped` or `withPermitsScoped` to acquire and
 * release permits within the context of a scoped effect for composing with
 * other resources.
 *
 * For more advanced concurrency problems you can use the `acquire` and
 * `release` operators directly, or their variants `acquireN` and `releaseN`,
 * all of which return STM transactions. Thus, they can be composed to form
 * larger STM transactions, for example acquiring permits from two different
 * semaphores transactionally and later releasing them transactionally to safely
 * synchronize on access to two different mutable variables.
