/**
 * [[LogLevel]] represents the log level associated with an individual logging
 * operation. Log levels are used both to describe the granularity (or
 * importance) of individual log statements, as well as to enable tuning
 * verbosity of log output.
 *
 * @param ordinal
 *   The priority of the log message. Larger values indicate higher priority.
 * @param label
 *   A label associated with the log level.
 * @param syslog
 *   The syslog severity level of the log level.
 *
 * [[LogLevel]] values are ZIO aspects, and therefore can be used with aspect
