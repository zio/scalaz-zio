/**
 * `ZState[S]` models a value of type `S` that can be read from and written to
 * during the execution of an effect. The idiomatic way to work with `ZState`
 * is as part of the environment using operators defined on `ZIO`. For
 * example:
 *
 * {{{
 * final case class MyState(counter: Int)
 *
 * for {
 *   _     <- ZIO.updateState[MyState](state => state.copy(counter = state.counter + 1))
 *   count <- ZIO.getStateWith[MyState](_.counter)
 * } yield count
 * }}}
 *
 * Because `ZState` is typically used as part of the environment, it is
 * recommended to define your own state type `S` such as `MyState` above
 * rather than using a type such as `Int` to avoid the risk of ambiguity.
 *
 * To run an effect that depends on some state, create the initial state with
 * the `make` constructor and then use `toLayer` to convert it into a layer
 * that you can provide along with your application's other dependencies.
