/**
 * A [[WeakConcurrentBag]] stores a collection of values that will ultimately be
 * wrapped in a `WeakReference`, if they are survive long enough in a 'nursery'.
 * The structure is optimized for addition, and will achieve zero allocations in
 * the happy path. There is no way to remove values from the bag, as they will
 * be automatically removed assuming they become unreachable.
 *
 * The larger the nursery size, the less weak references will be created,
 * because the more values will die before they are forced out of the nursery.
 * However, larger nursery sizes use more memory, and increase the worst
 * possible performance of the `add` method, which has to do maintenance of the
 * nursery and occassional garbage collection.
