What it means is that tests (and other accompanying concepts like assertions) become ordinary values that can be passed around, transformed and composed together. This approach allows for greater flexibility comparing to some other testing frameworks where tests and additional logic around tests had to be put into callbacks so that framework could make use of them. This approach also fits better with other ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"ZIO"})," concepts like ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"ZManaged"})," which can only be used within a scoped block of code. This also created a mismatch between ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"BeforeAll"}),", ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"AfterAll"}),' callback-like methods when there were resources that should be opened and closed during test suite execution.\nAnother thing worth pointing out is that tests being values, are also effects. Implications of this design are far reaching. First of all well known problem of testing asynchronous value is gone. Whereas in other frameworks you have to somehow "run" your effects\nand at best wrap them in ',(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"scala.util.Future"})," because blocking would eliminate running on ScalaJS, ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"zio-test"})," expects you to create ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"ZIO"})," objects. There is no need for indirect transformations from one wrapping object to another. Second, because our tests are ordinary ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"ZIO"})," values we don't need to turn to testing framework for things like retries, timeouts and resource management.

Instead of providing one ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"ZIO"})," application\nat the end of the world we provide a suite that can be a tree of other suites and tests. Another resemblance is that ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"DefaultRunnableSpec"})," provides an Environment. Here it is an instance of ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"TestEnvironment"})," which helps us with controlling our systems infrastructure. More info on using test environment can be found in sections below.\nJust like with ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"zio.App"})," where at the very end an instance of ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"ZIO[R,E,A]"})," is expected where ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"R"})," can be at maximum of type ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Environment"})," in ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"DefaultRunnableSpec"})," ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"R"})," cannot be more than ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"TestEnvironment"}),". So just like in normal application if our\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"R"})," is composed of some other modules we need to provide them first before test can be executed. How can we provide our dependencies?\nHere again the design of ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"zio-test"})," shines. Since our tests are ordinary values we can just transform them with a call to ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"mapTest"}),".\nIt accepts a lambda of type ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"ZIO[R with TestSystem, TestFailure[Throwable], TestSuccess[Unit] ] => T1"}),".
