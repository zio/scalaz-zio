The Scala compiler can catch a lot of errors at compile time since it is type-safe. This ensures that our code is mostly correct, and it prevents lots of bugs from creeping into the runtime. So having a type-safe editor that highlights errors will improve our development experience. VSCode with the power of the Metals extension provides us with a type-safe editor for writing Scala programs.","source":"@site/docs/guides/tutorials/run-our-first-zio-project-with-vscode.md","sourceDirName":"guides/tutorials","slug":"/guides/tutorials/run-our-first-zio-project-with-vscode","permalink":"/guides/tutorials/run-our-first-zio-project-with-vscode","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/zio/zio/edit/series/2.x/docs/guides/tutorials/run-our-first-zio-project-with-vscode.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{"id":"run-our-first-zio-project-with-vscode","title":"Tutorial: How to Run Our First ZIO Project With VSCode?","sidebar_label":"Running Our First ZIO Project With VSCode"},"sidebar":"guides-sidebar","previous":{"title":"Create Custom Logger for a ZIO Application","permalink":"/guides/tutorials/create-custom-logger-for-a-zio-application"},"next":{"title":"Running Our First ZIO Project With IntelliJ IDEA","permalink":"/guides/tutorials/run-our-first-zio-project-with-intellij-idea"}},{"id":"izumi-reflect/index","title":"Introduction to izumi-reflect","description":"@quote: Looks a bit similar to TypeTag","source":"@site/docs/izumi-reflect/index.md","sourceDirName":"izumi-reflect","slug":"/izumi-reflect/","permalink":"/izumi-reflect/","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/zio/zio/edit/series/2.x/docs/izumi-reflect/index.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{"id":"index","title":"Introduction to izumi-reflect","sidebar_label":"izumi-reflect"},"sidebar":"ecosystem-sidebar","previous":{"title":"ZIO Ecosystem Official Libraries","permalink":"/ecosystem/officials/"},"next":{"title":"ZIO 2.x Interop Cats 2.x","permalink":"/zio2-interop-cats2/"}},{"id":"overview/basic-concurrency","title":"Basic Concurrency","description":"ZIO is a highly concurrent framework, powered by fibers, which are lightweight virtual threads that achieve massive scalability compared to threads, augmented with resource-safe cancellation, which powers many features in ZIO.","source":"@site/docs/overview/basic-concurrency.md","sourceDirName":"overview","slug":"/overview/basic-concurrency","permalink":"/overview/basic-concurrency","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/zio/zio/edit/series/2.x/docs/overview/basic-concurrency.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{"id":"basic-concurrency","title":"Basic Concurrency"},"sidebar":"overview_sidebar","previous":{"title":"Handling Resources","permalink":"/overview/handling-resources"},"next":{"title":"Running Effects","permalink":"/overview/running-effects"}},{"id":"overview/basic-operations","title":"Basic Operations","description":"Like the String data type, as well as the collection data types in Scala (such as List, Map, and Set), ZIO effects are immutable, and cannot be changed.","source":"@site/docs/overview/basic-operations.md","sourceDirName":"overview","slug":"/overview/basic-operations","permalink":"/overview/basic-operations","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/zio/zio/edit/series/2.x/docs/overview/basic-operations.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{"id":"basic-operations","title":"Basic Operations"},"sidebar":"overview_sidebar","previous":{"title":"Creating Effects","permalink":"/overview/creating-effects"},"next":{"title":"Handling Errors","permalink":"/overview/handling-errors"}},{"id":"overview/creating-effects","title":"Creating Effects","description":"This section explores some of the common ways to create ZIO effects from values, from computations, and from common Scala data types.","source":"@site/docs/overview/creating-effects.md","sourceDirName":"overview","slug":"/overview/creating-effects","permalink":"/overview/creating-effects","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/zio/zio/edit/series/2.x/docs/overview/creating-effects.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{"id":"creating-effects","title":"Creating Effects"},"sidebar":"overview_sidebar","previous":{"title":"Summary","permalink":"/overview/summary"},"next":{"title":"Basic Operations","permalink":"/overview/basic-operations"}},{"id":"overview/getting-started","title":"Getting Started with ZIO","description":"Include ZIO in your project by adding the following to your build.sbt file:","source":"@site/docs/overview/index.md","sourceDirName":"overview","slug":"/overview/getting-started","permalink":"/overview/getting-started","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/zio/zio/edit/series/2.x/docs/overview/index.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{"id":"getting-started","title":"Getting Started with ZIO","sidebar_label":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started"},"sidebar":"overview_sidebar","next":{"title":"Summary","permalink":"/overview/summary"}},{"id":"overview/handling-errors","title":"Handling Errors","description":"ZIO effects may fail due to foreseen or unforeseen problems.

We have to document our configuration so it is clear to IT and DevOps how to configure our applications. We have to do strong validation with error accumulation to ensure bad data is rejected and good error messages are generated for end-users. In this presentation, Afsal Thaj, the author of ZIO Config, shows attendees how to solve all of these problems in a composable and testable way. By separating the description of configuration from what must be done with the configuration, ZIO Config provides all standard features\u2014including multiple data sources, data source overrides, documentation, and validation with error accumulation\u2014for free.
