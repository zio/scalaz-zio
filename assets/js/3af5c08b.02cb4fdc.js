This sort of workhorse thread pool is designed to be used for the majority of our application requirements. It has a certain number of threads in it and that stays constant over the lifetime of our application."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Why is that the case? Well because for the majority of workloads in our applications, it does not actually help things to create more threads than the number of CPU cores. If we have eight cores, it does not accelerate any sort of processing to create more than eight threads. Because at the end of the day our hardware is only capable of running eight things at the same time."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:"If we create a thousand threads on a system that can only run eight of them in parallel at a time, then what does the operating system do? As we have not enough CPU cores, the operating system starts giving a little slice of the eight cores to all these threads by switching between them over and over again."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The overhead for context switching between threads is significant. The CPU has to load in new registers, refill all its caches, it has to go through all these crazy complex processes that interfere with its main job to get stuff done. There's significant overhead associated with that. As a result, it's not going to be very efficient. We are going to waste a lot of our time and resources just switching back and forth between all these threads, that would kill our application."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:"So for that reason, ZIO's default thread pool is fixed with a number of threads equal to the number of CPU cores. That is the best practice.

What happens to all the other 100000 fibers in our system? They line up in a queue waiting for their chance to run. That's not ideal. That's why we should take these effects that either do blocking I/O, or they do big CPU Work that's not chunked and run them using ZIO's blocking thread pool which will give us a dedicated thread."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:"That dedicated thread is not efficient, but again, sometimes we have to interact with legacy code and legacy code is full of blocking code.

Instead of waiting to read the next chunk from a socket or instead of waiting to acquire a lock, all we have to do is call it and give it a callback. It doesn't need to do anything else.
