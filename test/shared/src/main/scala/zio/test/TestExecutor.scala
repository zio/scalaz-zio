/**
 * A `TestExecutor[R0, R1, E]` is capable of executing specs that require an
 * environment of `R0 with R1` and may fail with an `E`. The environment is
 * split into two components:
 *  - `R0` is provided to the `Spec` by this `TestExecutor` using the layer
 *    returned by the implementation of the `environment` method. As a result,
 *    this part of the environment is never shared between tests.
 *  - The other part of the environment (`R1`) must be provided by code outside
 *    of this `TestExecutor`, which makes it possible to create a shared version
 *    of that dependency, and use it to run multiple independent specs.
