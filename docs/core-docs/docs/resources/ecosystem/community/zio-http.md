[ZIO HTTP](https://github.com/dream11/zio-http) is a scala library to write HTTP applications.

## Introduction

ZIO HTTP is a Scala library for building HTTP applications. It is powered by ZIO and netty and aims at being the defacto solution for writing, highly scalable, and performant web applications using idiomatic scala.

## Installation

In order to use this library, we need to add the following lines in our `build.sbt` file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.d11" %% "zhttp"      % "2.0.0-RC7"
libraryDependencies += "io.d11" %% "zhttp-test" % "2.0.0-RC7" % Test
```

## Example

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zhttp.http._
import zhttp.service.Server
import zio._

object ZHttpExample extends ZIOAppDefault {

  // Create HTTP route
  val app: HttpApp[Any, Nothing] =
    Http.collect[Request] {
      case Method.GET -> !! / "text" => Response.text("Hello World!")
      case Method.GET -> !! / "json" =>
        Response.json("""{"greetings": "Hello World!"}""")
    }

  def run =
    Server.start(8090, app)
}
```
