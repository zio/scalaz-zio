The ZIO library lets you easily solve problems in a variety of areas, including:

 - [**Asynchronous Programming**](asynchronous.md) — Write asynchronous code as easily as synchronous code, handling all errors and never leaking resources.
 - [**Concurrent Programming**](concurrency.md) — Write concurrent code that scales easily, without locks or deadlocks, with maximal laziness and resource safety.
 - [**Parallelism**](parallelism.md) — Trivially partition work among many parallel fibers to make short work of CPU-intensive processing.
 - [**Queueing**](queueing.md) — Build work processing flows and ration scarce resources with powerful asynchronous queues.
 - [**Retrying**](retrying.md) — Create and test robust retry strategies that make your application resilient to transient failures.
 - [**Scheduling**](scheduling.md) — Schedule repeating work, like report generation or email notifications, using flexible, composable schedules.
 - [**Streaming**](streaming.md) — Handle huge or infinite amounts of data in constant heap space with efficient, lazy, concurrent streams.
 - [**Testing**](testing.md) - Easily test effectual programs with powerful combinators, built-in property based testing, and seamless mocking capabilities.

Explore the pages above and learn how the simple, powerful building blocks in ZIO help you solve problems in these critical areas.
