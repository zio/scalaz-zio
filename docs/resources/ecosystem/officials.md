title:  "Official ZIO Libraries"

## Introduction 

These libraries are hosted in the [ZIO organization](https://github.com/zio/) on Github, and are generally maintained by core contributors to ZIO.

Each project in the ZIO organization namespace has a _Stage Badge_ which indicates the current status of that project:

* **Production Ready** — The project is stable and already used in production. We can expect reliability for the implemented use cases.

* **Development** — The project already has RC or milestone releases, but is still under active development. We should not expect full stability yet.

* **Experimental** — The project is not yet released, but an important part of the work is already done.

* **Research** — The project is at the design stage, with some sketches of work but nothing usable yet.

* **Concept** — The project is just an idea, development hasn't started yet.

* **Deprecated** — The project is not maintained anymore, and we don't recommend its usage.
