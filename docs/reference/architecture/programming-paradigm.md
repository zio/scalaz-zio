It is important to realize that the programming paradigm used to write a software system has a significant impact on its design and architecture. In this section, we are going to talk the foundation of ZIO from the programming paradigm perspective:

- Functional and object-oriented programming
- Declarative and imperative programming
- Structured Programming
- Aspect-oriented Programming

## Functional and Object-Oriented Programming

Every computer program is written in the form of a set of operations and data structures:

- A data are nouns in the program, such as `Person`, `Address`, `Order`, etc. They represent a piece of information, configuration, or state that is used by operations.
- Operations are verbs, such as `createOrder`, `updateOrder`, `deleteOrder`, and etc. They are methods or functions that operate on data.

The way we organize these two elements in our program determines the programming paradigm we use; object-oriented programming (OOP) or functional programming (FP).
