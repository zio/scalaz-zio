A `Gen[R, A]` represents a generator of values of type `A`, which requires an environment `R`. The `Gen` data type is the base functionality for generating test data for property-based testing. We use them to produce deterministic and non-deterministic (PRNG) random values.

It is encoded as a stream of optional samples:

```scala
case class Gen[-R, +A](sample: ZStream[R, Nothing, Option[Sample[R, A]]])
```

Before deep into the generators, let's see what is property-based testing and what problem it solves in the testing world.

## Running a Generator

To run a generator, we can call `runCollect` operation:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
import zio._
import zio.test._

val ints: ZIO[Any, Nothing, List[Int]] = Gen.int.runCollect.debug
// Output: List(-2090696713)
```

This will return a `ZIO` effect containing all its values in a list, which in this example it contains only one element.

To create more samples, we can use `Gen#runCollectN`, which repeatedly runs the generator as much as we need. In this example, it will generate a list of containing 5 integer elements:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
Gen.int.runCollectN(5).debug
// Output: List(281023690, -1852531706, -21674662, 187993034, -868811035)
```

In addition, there is an operator called `Gen#runHead`, which returns the first value generated by the generator.
