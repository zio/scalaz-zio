    + **[IO](core/zio/io.md)** — `IO[E, A]` is a type alias for `ZIO[Any, E, A]`.
- **[ZIOApp](core/zioapp.md)** — `ZIOApp` and the `ZIOAppDefault` are entry points for ZIO applications.
- **[Runtime](core/runtime.md)** — `Runtime[R]` is capable of executing tasks within an environment `R`.
- **[Exit](core/exit.md)** — `Exit[E, A]` describes the result of executing an `IO` value.
- **[Cause](core/cause.md)** — `Cause[E]` is a description of a full story of a fiber failure.

## Contextual Data Types

- **[ZEnvironment](contextual/zenvironment.md)** — `ZEnvironment[R]` is a built-in type-level map for the `ZIO` data type which is responsible for maintaining the environment of a `ZIO` effect.
- **[ZLayer](contextual/zlayer.md)** — `ZLayer[-RIn, +E, +ROut]` is a recipe to build an environment of type `ROut`, starting from a value `RIn`, and possibly producing an error `E` during creation.
    + **[RLayer](contextual/rlayer.md)** — `RLayer[-RIn, +ROut]` is a type alias for `ZLayer[RIn, Throwable, ROut]`, which represents a layer that requires `RIn` as its input, it may fail with `Throwable` value, or returns `ROut` as its output.
    + **[ULayer](contextual/ulayer.md)** — `ULayer[+ROut]` is a type alias for `ZLayer[Any, Nothing, ROut]`, which represents a layer that doesn't require any services as its input, it can't fail, and returns `ROut` as its output.
    + **[Layer](contextual/layer.md)** — `Layer[+E, +ROut]` is a type alias for `ZLayer[Any, E, ROut]`, which represents a layer that doesn't require any services, it may fail with an error type of `E`, and returns `ROut` as its output.
    + **[URLayer](contextual/urlayer.md)** — `URLayer[-RIn, +ROut]` is a type alias for `ZLayer[RIn, Nothing, ROut]`, which represents a layer that requires `RIn` as its input, it can't fail, and returns `ROut` as its output.

## State Management

- **[ZState](state-management/zstate.md)**— It models a state that can be read from and written to during the execution of an effect.
- **[Ref](state-management/global-shared-state.md)**— `Ref[A]` models a mutable reference to a value of type `A`.
- **[FiberRef](state-management/fiberref.md)**— `FiberRef[A]` models a mutable reference to a value of type `A`. As opposed to `Ref[A]`, a value is bound to an executing `Fiber` only.  You can think of it as Java's `ThreadLocal` on steroids.

## Concurrency

### Fiber Primitives

- **[Fiber](fiber/fiber.md)** — A fiber value models an `IO` value that has started running, and is the moral equivalent of a green thread.
- **[Fiber.Status](fiber/fiberstatus.md)** — `Fiber.Status` describe the current status of a Fiber.
- **[FiberId](fiber/fiberid.md)** — `FiberId` describe the unique identity of a Fiber.

### Concurrency Primitives

- **[Hub](concurrency/hub.md)** — A `Hub` is an asynchronous message hub that allows publishers to efficiently broadcast values to many subscribers.
- **[Promise](concurrency/promise.md)** — A `Promise` is a model of a variable that may be set a single time, and awaited on by many fibers.

- **[Ref](concurrency/ref.md)** — `Ref[A]` models a mutable reference to a value of type `A`. The two basic operations are `set`, which fills the `Ref` with a new value, and `get`, which retrieves its current content. All operations on a `Ref` are atomic and thread-safe, providing a reliable foundation for synchronizing concurrent programs.
- **[Ref.Synchronized](concurrency/refsynchronized.md)** — `Ref.Synchronized[A]` models a **mutable reference** to a value of type `A` in which we can store **immutable** data, and update it atomically **and** effectfully.
- **[Queue](concurrency/queue.md)** — A `Queue` is an asynchronous queue that never blocks, which is safe for multiple concurrent producers and consumers.

### Synchronization Aids

- **[ReentrantLock](sync/reentrantlock.md)**— The `ReentrantLock` is a synchronization tool that is useful for synchronizing blocks of code.
- **[CountdownLatch](sync/countdownlatch.md)** — A synchronization aid that allows one or more fibers to wait until a set of operations being performed in other fibers completes.
- **[CyclicBarrier](sync/cyclicbarrier.md)** — A synchronization aid that allows a set of fibers to all wait for each other to reach a common barrier point.
- **[ConcurrentMap](sync/concurrentmap.md)** — A Map wrapper over `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`
- **[ConcurrentSet](sync/concurrentset.md)** — A Set implementation over `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`

### STM

- **[STM](stm/stm.md)** — An `STM` represents an effect that can be performed transactionally resulting in a failure or success.
- **[TArray](stm/tarray.md)** — A `TArray` is an array of mutable references that can participate in transactions.
- **[TSet](stm/tset.md)** — A `TSet` is a mutable set that can participate in transactions.
- **[TMap](stm/tmap.md)** — A `TMap` is a mutable map that can participate in transactions.
- **[TRef](stm/tref.md)** — A `TRef` is a mutable reference to an immutable value that can participate in transactions.
- **[TPriorityQueue](stm/tpriorityqueue.md)** — A `TPriorityQueue` is a mutable priority queue that can participate in transactions.
- **[TPromise](stm/tpromise.md)** — A `TPromise` is a mutable reference that can be set exactly once and can participate in transactions.
- **[TQueue](stm/tqueue.md)** — A `TQueue` is a mutable queue that can participate in transactions.
- **[TReentrantLock](stm/treentrantlock.md)** — A `TReentrantLock` is a reentrant read / write lock that can be composed.
- **[TSemaphore](stm/tsemaphore.md)** — A `TSemaphore` is a semaphore that can participate in transactions.

## Resource Management

- **[Scope](resource/scope.md)** — A scope in which resources can safely be used.
- **[ZPool](resource/zpool.md)** — An asynchronous and concurrent generalized pool of reusable resources.

## Streaming

- **[ZStream](stream/zstream/zstream.md)** — `ZStream` is a lazy, concurrent, asynchronous source of values.
    + **[Stream](stream/zstream/stream.md)** — `Stream[E, A]` is a type alias for `ZStream[Any, E, A]`, which represents a ZIO stream that does not require any services, and may fail with an `E`, or produce elements with an `A`.
- **[ZSink](stream/zsink/zsink.md)** — `ZSink` is a consumer of values from a `ZStream`, which may produce a value when it has consumed enough.
    + **[Sink](stream/zsink/sink.md)** — `Sink[InErr, A, OutErr, L, B]` is a type alias for `ZSink[Any, InErr, A, OutErr, L, B]`.
- **[ZPipeline](stream/zpipeline.md)** — `ZPipeline` is a polymorphic stream transformer.
- **[SubscriptionRef](stream/subscriptionref.md)** — `SubscriptionRef[A]` contains a current value of type `A` and a stream that can be consumed to observe all changes to that value.

## Metrics

IO supports 5 types of Metrics:

- **[Counter](observability/metrics/counter.md)** — The Counter is used for any value that increases over time like _request counts_.
- **[Gauge](observability/metrics/gauge.md)** — The gauge is a single numerical value that can arbitrary goes up or down over time like _memory usage_.
- **[Histogram](observability/metrics/histogram.md)** — The Histogram is used to track the distribution of a set of observed values across a set of buckets like _request latencies_.
- **[Summary](observability/metrics/summary.md)** — The Summary represents a sliding window of a time series along with metrics for certain percentiles of the time series, referred to as quantiles like _request latencies_.
- **[Frequency](observability/metrics/setcount.md)** — The Frequency is a metric that counts the number of occurrences of distinct string values.

## Testing

- **[Assertion](test/assertion.md)**— An `Assertion[A]` is a test assertion that can be used to assert the predicate of type `A => Boolean`.
- **[TestAspect](test/aspects/test-aspect.md)**— A `TestAspect` is an aspect that can be weaved into specs. We can think of an aspect as a polymorphic function, capable of transforming one test into another.
- **[Gen](test/gen.md)**— A `Gen[R, A]` represents a generator of values of type `A`, which requires an environment `R`.
- **Test Service**— ZIO Test has the following out-of-the-box test services:
    - **[TestConsole](test/services/console.md)**— It allows testing of applications that interact with the console.
    - **[TestClock](test/services/clock.md)**— We can deterministically and efficiently test effects involving the passage of time without actually having to wait for the full amount of time to pass.
