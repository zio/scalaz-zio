## Upgrading Dependencies

If we are using one of the following dependencies, we need to upgrade them to the `2.0.0-M2` version:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %% "zio"         % "2.0.0-M2"
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %% "zio-streams" % "2.0.0-M2"
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %% "zio-test"    % "2.0.0-M2"
```
