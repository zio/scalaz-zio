title:  "Running Effects"

ZIO provides several different ways of running effects in your application.

## App

If you construct a single effect for your whole program, then the most natural way to run the effect is to extend `zio.App`. 

This class provides Scala with a main function, so it can be called from IDEs and launched from the command-line. All you have to do is implement the `run` method, which will be passed all command-line arguments in a `List`:

```scala mdoc:silent
import zio._
import zio.console._

object MyApp extends zio.App {

  def run(args: List[String]) =
    myAppLogic.exitCode

  val myAppLogic =
    for {
      _    <- putStrLn("Hello! What is your name?")
      name <- getStrLn
      _    <- putStrLn(s"Hello, ${name}, welcome to ZIO!")
    } yield ()
}
```

If you are using a custom environment for your application, you will have to supply your environment to the effect (using `ZIO#provide`) before you return it from `run`, because `App` does not know how to supply custom environments.

## Default Runtime

Most applications are not greenfield, and must integrate with legacy code, and procedural libraries and frameworks.

In these cases, a better solution for running effects is to create a `Runtime`, which can be passed around and used to run effects wherever required.

ZIO contains a default runtime called `Runtime.default`. This `Runtime` bundles together production implementations of all ZIO modules (including `Console`, `System`, `Clock`, `Random`, `Scheduler`, and on the JVM, `Blocking`), and it can run effects that require any combination of these modules.

To access it, merely use

```scala mdoc:silent
val runtime = Runtime.default
```

Once you have a runtime, you can use it to execute effects:

```scala mdoc:silent
runtime.unsafeRun(ZIO(println("Hello World!")))
```

In addition to the `unsafeRun` method, there are other methods that allow executing effects asynchronously or into `Future` values.

## Custom Runtime

If you are using a custom environment for your application, then you may find it useful to create a `Runtime` specifically tailored for that environment.

A custom `Runtime[R]` can be created with two values:

 - **`R` Environment**. This is the environment that will be provided to effects when they are executed.
 - **`Platform`**. This is a platform that is required by ZIO in order to bootstrap the runtime system.

For example, the following creates a `Runtime` that can provide an `Int` to effects, using the default `Platform` provided by ZIO:

```scala mdoc:silent
import zio.internal.Platform

val myRuntime: Runtime[Int] = Runtime(42, Platform.default)
```

## Error Reporting

In the `Platform` that is a part of every runtime, there is an error reporter that will be called by ZIO to report every unhandled error. It is a good idea to supply your own error reporter, which can log unhandled errors to a file.

The default unhandled error reporter merely logs the error to standard error.

## Next Steps

If you are comfortable with running effects, then congratulations!
