title: "How to Use Test Assertions"
---

Using the `Assertion` type effectively often involves finding the best fitting
function for the type of assumptions you would like to verify.

This list is intended to break up the available functions into groups based on
the _Result type_. The types of the functions are included as well, to guide
intuition.

For instance, if we wanted to assert that the fourth element of a `Vector[Int]`
was a value equal to the number `5`, we would first look at assertions that
operate on `Seq[A]`, with the type `Assertion[Seq[A]]`.

For this example, I would select `hasAt`, as it accepts both the position into
a sequence, as well as an `Assertion[A]` to apply at that position:

```scala
Assertion.hasAt[A](pos: Int)(assertion: Assertion[A]): Assertion[Seq[A]]
```

I could start by writing:

```scala mdoc:reset:invisible
import zio.test._, zio.test.Assertion._
```

```scala mdoc
val xs = Vector(0, 1, 2, 3)

test("Fourth value is equal to 5") {
  assert(xs)(hasAt(3)(???))
}
```

The second parameter to `hasAt` is an `Assertion[A]` that applies to the third
element of that sequence, so I would look for functions that operate on `A`,
of the return type `Assertion[A]`.

I could select `equalTo`, as it accepts an `A` as a parameter, allowing me to
supply `5`:

```scala mdoc:reset:invisible
import zio.test._, zio.test.Assertion._
```

```scala mdoc
val xs = Vector(0, 1, 2, 3)

test("Fourth value is equal to 5") {
  assert(xs)(hasAt(3)(equalTo(5)))
}
```

Let's say this is too restrictive, and I would prefer to assert that a value is
_near_ the number five, with a tolerance of two. This requires a little more
knowledge of the type `A`, so I'll look for an assertion in the `Numeric`
section. `approximatelyEquals` looks like what we want, as it permits the
starting value `reference`, as well as a `tolerance`, for any `A` that is
`Numeric`:

```scala
Assertion.approximatelyEquals[A: Numeric](reference: A, tolerance: A): Assertion[A]
```

Changing out `equalTo` with `approximatelyEquals` leaves us with:

```scala mdoc:reset:invisible
import zio.test._, zio.test.Assertion._
```

```scala mdoc
val xs = Vector(0, 1, 2, 3)

test("Fourth value is approximately equal to 5") {
  assert(xs)(hasAt(3)(approximatelyEquals(5, 2)))
}
```
