`IO[E, A]` is a type alias for `ZIO[Any, E, A]`, which represents an effect that has no requirements, and may fail with an `E`, or succeed with an `A`.

> **Note:**
>
> In Scala, the _type alias_ is a way to give a name to another type, to avoid having to repeat the original type again and again. It doesn't affect the type-checking process. It just helps us to have an expressive API design.

Let's see how the `IO` type alias is defined:

```scala mdoc:invisible
import zio.ZIO
```

```scala mdoc:silent
type IO[+E, +A] = ZIO[Any, E, A]
```

So the `IO` just equal to `ZIO` which doesn't need any requirement.

`ZIO` values of type `IO[E, Nothing]` (where the value type is `Nothing`) are considered _unproductive_, because the `Nothing` type is _uninhabitable_, i.e. there can be no actual values of type `Nothing`. Values of this type may fail with an `E`, but will never produce a value.

> **Note:** _Principle of The Least Power_
>
> The `ZIO` data type is the most powerful effect in the ZIO library. It helps us to model various types of workflows. On other hand, the type aliases are a way of subtyping and specializing the `ZIO` type, specific for a less powerful workflow. 
>
> Lot of the time, we don't need such a piece of powerful machinery. So as a rule of thumb, whenever we require a less powerful effect, it's better to use the proper specialized type alias.
>
> So there is no need to convert type aliases to the `ZIO` data type, whenever the `ZIO` data type is required, we can use the most precise type alias to fit our workflow requirement.
