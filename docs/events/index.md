### ZIO Hackathons

ZIO Hackathons are designed to bring together many core contributors to ZIO from all around the world, as well as current ZIO users, future ZIO users and contributors, and contributors to other libraries for async and concurrent programming in the broader functional Scala ecosystem.

The goal of the hackathon is to work on ZIO and related libraries, improve the ecosystem, and have fun. We will have a number of ZIO core contributors present to help with questions and to work on ZIO. So by attending a ZIO Hackathon, you will have the opportunity to pair with other ZIO contributors and to learn from them.
